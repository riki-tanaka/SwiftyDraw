## Overview

SwiftyDraw is a simple, lightweight drawing framework written in Swift. SwiftyDraw is built using Core Gaphics and is very easy to implement.

## Requirements
* iOS 8.0+
* Swift 3.0

## License

SwiftyDraw  is available under the BSD license. See the LICENSE file for more info.

## Installation

### Cocoapods:

SwiftyDraw is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "SwiftyDraw"
```

### Manual Installation:

Simply copy the contents of the Source folder into your project.

## Usage

Using SwiftyDraw is very simple:

### Getting Started:

Simply create a SwiftyDrawView and add it to your View Controller:

```swift
let drawView = SwiftyDrawView(frame: self.view.frame)
self.view.addSubview(drawView)
```
    
By default, the view will automatically respond to touch gestures and begin drawing. The default color is **black**.

To disable drawing, simply set the `drawingEnabled` property to false:

```swift
drawView.drawingEnabled = false
```
    
## Customization

### Line Color:

The color of a line stoke can be changed by adjusting the `lineColor` property. SwiftyDraw accepts any UIColor:

```swift
drawView.lineColor = UIColor.red
```
    
<p align="center">
  or
</p>

```swift
drawView.lineColor = UIColor(colorLiteralRed: 0.75, green: 0.50, blue: 0.88, alpha: 1.0)
```    
### Line Width:

The with of a line stroke can be changed by adjusting the `lineWidth` property. SwiftyDraw accepts any positive CGFloat:

```swift
drawView.lineWidth = CGFloat(5.0)
```

### Line Opacity:

The opacity of a line stoke can be changed by adjusting the `lineOpacity` property. SwiftyDraw accepts a CGFloat between 0. and 1.0:

```swift
drawView.lineOpacity = CGFloat(0.5)
```
    
## Editing

### Remove Last Line:

SwiftyDraw has the option to clear the last line segment. Simply call the `removeLastLine` function:

```swift
drawView.removeLastLine()
```

This can be called several times, or until the canvas is clear.


### Clear All:

If you wish to clear the entire canvas, simply call the `clearCanvas` function:

```swift
drawView.clearCanvas()
```   
    
## Delegate

SwiftyDraw has delegate functions to notify you when a user is interacting with a SwiftDrawView. To access these delegate methods, simply add your View Controller as the `SwiftyDrawViewDelegate`:

```swift
class ViewController: UIViewController, SwiftyDrawViewDelegate
```
    
There are four optional delegate methods:

```swift
func SwiftyDrawDidBeginDrawing(view: SwiftyDrawView) {

    // Called when the SwiftyDrawView detects touches have begun.
    
}
    
func SwiftyDrawIsDrawing(view: SwiftyDrawView) { 

	// Called when the SwiftyDrawView detects touches are currrently occuring. 
	// Will be called multiple times.
	
}
    
func SwiftyDrawDidFinishDrawing(view: SwiftyDrawView) {

	// Called when the SwiftyDrawView detects touches have ended for the particular line segment
	
}
    
func SwiftyDrawDidCancelDrawing(view: SwiftyDrawView) {

	// Called if SwiftyDrawView detects issues with the gesture recognizers and cancels the drawing
	
}
```
